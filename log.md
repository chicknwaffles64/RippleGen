Started building the skeleton of the webpage.
Central div (id: tube) will hold the propogating wave. It will have fixed size (using pixels).

The full wave has 160 data points.
160 x (2px width + 2px gap) = 640 px, which is the full length of the medium.

user will be able to change tube's length (click and drag), and only the visible data points will be rendered

Screen width will be 1024px to accomadate most screens.


The relationship between wavelength (λ), frequency (f), and wave speed (v) is a fundamental concept in physics, expressed by the equation:

v=fλ

This equation holds true for all types of waves, from sound waves to light waves and water waves. Here's a breakdown of the causality and how it manifests in natural occurrences:

## Causality and the Relationship:

    Wave Speed (v): The speed at which a wave travels is primarily determined by the medium it is passing through.

    For example, sound travels faster in water than in air because water is denser and the particles are more closely packed, allowing vibrations to transmit more quickly.

Light travels fastest in a vacuum (the speed of light, c≈3×108 m/s) and slows down when passing through transparent materials like water or glass.
The speed of water waves can depend on factors like water depth and the wave's own wavelength.

Frequency (f): The frequency of a wave is determined by its source. It represents the number of complete wave cycles that pass a given point per unit of time (measured in Hertz, Hz, or cycles per second).

    When you pluck a guitar string, the rate at which it vibrates determines the frequency (and thus the pitch) of the sound wave produced.

The frequency of an electromagnetic wave (like light) is determined by the oscillations of electric charges in its source (e.g., electrons in an atom).

    Crucially, when a wave passes from one medium to another, its frequency remains constant. This is because the rate at which the source is vibrating doesn't change just because the wave enters a new material.

Wavelength (λ): The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive corresponding points on a wave (e.g., crest to crest or trough to trough). It is a consequence of the wave's speed and frequency.

    Since v=fλ, if the wave speed (v) is constant (as it often is for a given medium), then frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) are inversely proportional. This means if the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease, and vice versa.

If the wave speed (v) changes (because the medium changes), and the frequency (f) remains constant, then the wavelength (λ) must change to maintain the relationship.

In summary, the causal chain is generally:

    Source determines frequency.
    Medium determines wave speed.
    Wavelength adjusts to satisfy v=fλ.

Natural Occurrences Demonstrating this Causality:

    Sound Waves:
        Pitch and Wavelength: When you hear a high-pitched sound (high frequency), it has a short wavelength. A low-pitched sound (low frequency) has a long wavelength. Both travel at the same speed in the same air conditions. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength when speed is constant.

Sound in different media: Sound travels faster in water than in air. If you listen to an underwater sound that originated in air, its frequency remains the same (determined by the source), but its wavelength will increase as its speed increases in the water.

Light Waves (Electromagnetic Spectrum):

    Colors of Light: Different colors of visible light correspond to different frequencies and wavelengths. Red light has a lower frequency and longer wavelength than blue light, which has a higher frequency and shorter wavelength. All visible light travels at the speed of light (c) in a vacuum. This again shows the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength for a constant speed.

Refraction: When light passes from one medium to another (e.g., from air to water), its speed changes. For example, light slows down when entering water. The frequency of the light remains the same (determined by its source), but its wavelength decreases to accommodate the slower speed, causing the light to bend (refract). This is why a spoon in a glass of water appears bent.
Rainbows: Rainbows are formed when sunlight refracts and reflects through water droplets. Different wavelengths (colors) of light refract at slightly different angles due to their varying speeds in water, separating the white light into its constituent colors.

Water Waves:

    Ocean Swells vs. Wind Waves: Long-period ocean swells (low frequency, long wavelength) generated by distant storms travel much faster and further than short, choppy wind waves (high frequency, short wavelength) generated by local breezes. The wave speed for water waves is more complex and can depend on both wavelength and water depth. In deep water, longer wavelengths tend to travel faster.
